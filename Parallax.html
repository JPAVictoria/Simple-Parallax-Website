            <p><b>Terrestrial animals</b>, also known as<b> land animals</b> are animals<br> that live
                predominantly or entirely on land, as compared with<br> aquatic animals, which 
                live predominantly or entirely in the water,<br> and amphibians, which rely on
                a combination of aquatic and<br> terrestrial habitats. The term "terrestrial" is 
                typically applied to species<br> that live primarily on the ground, in contrast to
                 arboreal species, <br>which live primarily in trees.

                <p><b>Aquatic Animals</b>, also known as <b>water animals</b> are any animals,
                     whether<br> invertebrate or vertebrate, that lives in water for most or all
                      of its lifetime.<br> Many insects such as mosquitoes, mayflies, dragonflies 
                      and caddisflies <br>have aquatic larvae, with winged adults. Aquatic animals 
                      are animals <br>that live in the water. They either live in fresh water, such 
                      as lakes, rivers,<br> and ponds, or salt water, like the ocean. </p>

            <br>
            <p><b>Aerial Animals</b>, also known as <b>air animals</b> are animals that travel through the 
                air by<br> gliding from great heights or leaping from the depths. The flying animals are those<br>  
                species that have the ability to travel through the air by their own means, generally thanks<br> to 
                the ability to fly. Also known mainly as birds or insects, these types of animals<br> differ from terrestrials
                 by the presence of wings and feathers in their body, although there <br>are some subspecies that do not have them.
